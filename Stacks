### Stack
Stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and removal of existing items always takes place at the same end.
This end is called the Top.
The opposite end is called the Base.
Stack follows LIFO (Last in first out) principle.

Examples in everyday situations
- Stack of books/trays 
- Every web browser has a back button and stores URL in stack
- Current page - Top
- First page - Base
- Back button (Reverse order and reach back the base)
